                            <li><b>Identifying the problem</b></li>
                            <p>Browsing the web looking for fresh new startups in Romania doesn’t
                                end with a satisfactory result.</p>
                            <p>From an investor’s point of view, there is no way you can find
                                an opportunity for investment in an easy manner. Also, even if you may discover an article or two
                                presenting a startup on a website, getting in touch with company owners can be complicated if they do
                                not provide contact details.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, from an entrepreneurial point of view,
                                presenting a new business can be a tough thing at first, when financial resources are limited
                                and you can’t afford marketing campaigns. With no public display of your idea, you will never
                                get an investment to get you on track.</p>
                        </div>

                            <li><b>Finding the solution</b></li>
                            <p>Naturally, a way to solve the above problem is to bring both investors
                                and entrepreneurs together in the same place. The solution translates into a platform that both
                                sides will have access to, tailored to the needs of each.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, an entrepreneur is encouraged to present his idea of business,
                                along with essential details on the financial status of his startup. He can present the financial
                                developments over a recent period of time, if he makes profit or just covers his expenses, and also
                                if he needs other kind of resources, not necessarily money.</p>
                            <p>The more companies are registered, the higher the offer will be for investors,
                                increasing the chances of investing in a startup that suits their desires. Moreover, all the investors
                                can leave feedback to any company or help with various tips, which is an opportunity for companies to
                                evolve in the right direction.

                            <p>Before we start having conversations with potential customers, we will define the idea of the problem
                                we believe we are solving with our product. Then, we try to find our customer segment, the people that
                                are directly affected by the problem. Once we have a basic outline of the problem and our solution, we’re
                                ready to test our hypothesis. With all the feedback that we gather from potential customers, we will figure
                                out if our original hypothesis about the problem and our solution were correct.</p>

                            <p>The problem that we have discovered affects directly people who work or are interested in the IT industry,
                                therefore we chose our customer segment based on this observation. Since all the members of our team are
                                working in this field, each of us asked our colleagues from the faculty or workplace to help us with some
                                feedback. To get an entrepreneurial perspective, we asked for help from our SE colleagues, since all of them
                                have to build a startup this semester :). Looking for investors was a tougher job to do, but we will continue
                                working on that aspect.</p>
                            <p>We have created an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ygI_jGKqwZ0Q-slcG9mmDWtuUNIvclDd4q4r5_mcWHo/edit">online form</a> that we shared with people through emails, social media and group chats.
                                The questions that we asked were the following:</p>
                                <li>Cât de importantă credeți că este vizibilitatea pe piață a unui startup nou început ? (1 Foarte puțin

                                    (1 Foarte greu - 10 Foarte ușor)</li>

                            <p>For the first question, 51.9% of the interviewed believe that the visibility of a startup on the market is
                                very important, the other answers being found in the range from 6 to 9.</p>
                            <p>We found out that, in Romania, it’s not so easy for a startup to show its product or idea to an investor.
                                Most people voted 4 or 6 on the scale, and no one chose 9 or 10.</p>
                            <p>Opinions were divided on the third question and all of the suggested answers have been voted to a certain extent.</p>
                            <p>We wanted to see what people think about the problems that all the startups are facing. Among the answers
                                we found: lack of visibility on the market, dependence on a single client, insufficient funds, the need
                                to reinvent or improve the product and services to keep it relevant on the market, scalability, transition
                                from a small business mentality to one that involves standardization, creating efficient processes, team
                                conflicts, lack of experience, lack of a long-term financing plan.
